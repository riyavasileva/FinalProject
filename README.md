# FinalProject

## Summary
The project aims to build a model that ranks resumes based on job descriptions (=requirements) fit through NLP and machine learning.

This segment focuses on only one role (Data Analyst) and examines the performance of two main models:
* ranking based on cosine similiarity 
* ranking based on matching skills required to CVs

## Outcome
Both methods perform on a general level similarly as they did detect the data analytics profiles (out of a sample of 10).
The methods show some limirations though and cannot be used for sound decision-making, but only ranking. 

## Data
- [Job Description](https://github.com/riyavasileva/FinalProject/blob/main/Data%20Analyst_JD.docx)
- [Skills](https://github.com/riyavasileva/FinalProject/blob/main/DA_skills.csv) extracted in a csv form from the job description (using CSO and other tools)
- +2500 CV dataset downloaded (note: not uploaded to the repo as the file is too big)
